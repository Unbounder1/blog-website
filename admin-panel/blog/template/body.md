## This is a subheading
This is a jinja templated blog paragraph example. Here is an example of a variable used on compile time: {{ var1 }}. 

This should be another paragraph in the blog post. 
To implement an image, use jinja for formatting:

{{ image1 | image_process("alt text", ["large", "med", "small"])}}
