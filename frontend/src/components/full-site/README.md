Plan:
-> Create windowmanager to hydrate windows individually
-> Create a window component that houses all the insides
-> Move terminal component to be housed inside the window default component
-> Create blog post component

BaseTerminal.jsx = The overall constrainted terminal
BodyTerminal.jsx = The tab implementation and terminal output decisionmaking
GetBlogs.jsx = Output from ls ./
